<h1>The Best Movies According to Josue</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>It has been one of my favorite movies since I was a kid, besides being funny, colorfull, and with a good plot.<br>
It teaches you that love will come in an unexpected way.</p>
<h3>Kung Fu Panda</h3>
<p>Really cool and funny as Shrek, I love the plot and probably I will watch it again today.</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime. I love everything about it.</p>
